# PD_downsampler
Scripts to downsample PD complementarity and create a raster layer


 R script that allows to downsample taxa from pre-defined raster grid cells, calculate phylogenetic diversity complementarity values for this grid cells, and create a GIS raster ayer in .asc format. 
The R script only works on linux as it relies on two shell scripts that are also provided.

The script needs the following input (name of provided example files in brackets): 
* A csv file with the name of the locality in the first column and the tip labels in the following columns (input.csv)
* A phylogenetic tree in nexus format using the same tip labels as specified in the csv file (input.tree.csv)
* A csv file with the coordinates for the position of each grid cell (coordinates_localities.csv)


The shell script exec_pda.sh calls the software pda, that is used for calculation of phlyogenetic diversity complementarity. The path to the software needs to be specified in the script.

The software is available here: http://www.cibiv.at/software/pda/#download

The shell script "extract_PD_compl_results.sh" extracts the values from the result files and the line numbers from these .out files need to be specified.

Note: This code has been scripted for a specific task and will not run without prior edits of the user - passages where such edits are necessary are commented.
